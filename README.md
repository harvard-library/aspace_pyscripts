# aspace_pyscripts
Python scripts to support ongoing [ArchivesSpace](http://www.archivesspace.org) work at Harvard.

The first script is designed to create PUI-side PDF files to be stored in an AWS S3 bucket, so that they can be served from the Harvard's ArchivesSpace [Public User Interface](https://github.com/harvard-library/aspace-hvd-pui), as opposed to generating them on-the-fly.

Functionality that is potentially useful for additional scripts has been factored out into sub-folders.

## Dependencies

This work depends heavily on [ArchivesSnake](https://github.com/archivesspace-labs/ArchivesSnake).


## Batch-create PDFs

## Reusable functionality

### Handling S3 buckets

### Utilities
